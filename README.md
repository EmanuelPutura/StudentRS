# StudentRS
 StudentRS provides a students database and also a class record book. Teachers using the application are able to add, remove or update students and their grades/absences.
 
 ## Motivation and future improvements
 I created the application during highschool, as a helpful tool for my mother, who is a teacher. Hence, unfortunately, the application's UI is in Romanian. It is also worth mentioning that, being created a few years ago, during highschool, the application lacks several key concepts which I would use today, if I were to start refactoring the code (e.g., using a layered arhitecture, separating the user interface and the functionalities, better exception handling).
